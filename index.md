Nowadays all the new technology domains like 5G connectivity, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) are accelerating digitalization and many things that were previously not connected are getting connected. As more and more devices, vehicles, sensors and home appliances go online, enabling IP on everything becomes a vision and industry trend.

In this context, all the statistics show that IPv6 is growing constantly and faster than IPv4 in all measures such as number of users, percentage of content, and amount of traffic. For the first time in history, the user–network–content communication chain is ready for IPv6 and this means that the industry has selected IPv6 for the future.

On the other hand, networking field is in constant evolution and all the new use cases and scenarios were not mature or even did not exist when IPv6 was introduced. For this reason, IPv6 started its massive introduction recently and keeps evolving to prepare for the future and meet the new challenges as they arise.

As a matter of fact, the new requirements brought by 5G, IoT, Cloud, AI as well as governments and standard bodies are all calling for full IPv6 adoption.

The progress of IPv6 can be showed looking at the percentage of networks (Autonomous Systems) that announce one or more IPv6 prefixes in the RIPE NCC service region:

Between 2014 and 2020, ETSI established IP6 to sustain the global deployment of IPv6 and, as described in the recently published [ETSI White Paper 35](https://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_WP35_IPv6_Best_Practices_Benefits_Transition_Challenges_and_the_Way_Forward.pdf), the deployment of IPv6 provides the strong base for all the new technologies and new services evolution.

Given this background and driven by the emerging technologies, ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG) IPv6 Enhanced Innovations (IPE) aims to evolve the IP6 work further on, promoting the deployment of IPv6 according to an IPv6 network end-to-end reference architecture and defining clear guidelines to address large-scale IPv6 deployments. 

The ETSI ISG IPE opens the door to new opportunities for industry players by applying IPv6 technology to various scenarios and end-to-end solutions, in order to enable a new era of IPv6-based services and networks.
